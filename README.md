# cryoEM-notebooks

This repo contains information that we deem useful in understand the end-to-end problems of cryoEM and cryoET. Specifically, we develop jupyter notebooks that walks us through the mathematical and computational operations.

  - Microscope Architecture and Parameters
  - Detector Limits DQE, MTF etc.
  - Theoretical Limits
  - CTF
  - Origin of Noise
  - Beam Induced Motion

- Beam Induction Motion Correction
- Particle Picking
  - 2D Classification and Particle Rejection
- 3D Reconstruction - Inverse Problem
  - Pose Estimation
  - Volume Reconstruction
- Heterogenity
  - Multibody
